-ing and shouting...and yelling "Yeah!"
"OOOOoow!"
It really felt to me like Kathy was in "aerobics class" persona, just wearing a fancy costume.
During the fast portion of the workout, it is almost as if Kathy can't hear the music.
She has no natural rhythm, and frequently gets off beat with the music.
What I found funny about this, is that Ansuya and the other dancers refused to follow her and this point, and continued to dance WITH the rhythm and Kathy is left doing her own thing.
There should also have been a brief rundown of proper posture in the beginning before starting and there was not.
Other than the moves she learned from Ansuya, I would venture to say that Kathy doesn't know a doumbek from a zil...or a beledi from a karshlima.
Trust me...you want someone who DOES. To sum it up...Kathy saw the popularity in the Veena/Neena and Rania bellydance videos-and decided to jump on the bandwagon to make a few bucks.
She took a couple belly dance classes and then put out a video.
Sheesh. Ansuya should have known better than to sign on with this...because I actually think less of her now for putting her name on this one.
However, most belly dance exercise videos (such as those from Suhaila, Rania, Veena & Neena, etc.) are by women who have a lot of Middle Eastern dance experience-not by someone who just decided to "make a video" on it, but has no experience at all.
However something is decidedly lost in the translation of dysfunctional families in suburbia.
Namely the decision to give Billy a backstory.
I'm no prude but I think Roth skimped out on the Gran Guignol this could've been and without sounding sadomasochistic I like my gore to be buckets of, not a sponge job.
The scares that fail to come are largely due to Roth's build up (finally) after nearly a half hour of lead up with unlikable characters whose sympathy we're supposed to gather by the time they meet their fates with grisly results when in fact the punches are indeed pulled.
I admit the last fifteen minutes make up for the lack of ghoulish could've beens with gusto and self-righteous "yeah" paybacks but the trip itself is unsavory.
If you can gather that this is pure Hollywood hokum formulaic military maverick wanting a chance to redeem himself than don't bother buying a ticket (or wait for the inevitable DVD rental).
It's hard to believe this is director Lin's follow-up from his remarkable debut with the indie fave "Better Luck Tomorrow" but if you're gonna sell out it could be a lot worse.
However in its latest incarnation the answer seems to be repetitive (ie we've seen it before).
WHITE NOISE taps into many other (and better envisioned) sources of the ghostly genre including a score of old "Twilight Zone"'s, "POLTERGEIST", 'THE CHANGELING", "AUDREY ROSE", "THE SIXTH SENSE" and "THE RING" to name several off the top of my head.
The film however falls apart in the climactic final moments, which allows the next film in line to continue the quest for What Happens When We Die; only time will tell.
Without them, i would have left in the middle.
"Lola" is the worse actress in probably...the universe.
You have the new XXX (Ice Cube) who no matter how good is acting is is a pimp!
But then you have the "Lola" who looks like a man and the love between Darius Stone and Lola is sooo unbelievable.
And the ending scene on the train to me, i was thinking, "that would never ever happen".
A lot of action movies have the unbelievability factor, but for me, i actually found myself thinking how bull***** this movie was.
It has some special effects, but you will not leave the theatre with a good feeling, just a wanting for your money back!
This is the reason that this movie should not have been re-made.
I think a large majority of the effect was lost in making this movie in color.
I believe that it would have been a lot better in black and white like the original.
But if you are going to copy a movie frame for frame, what is the point of making it?
They should have just re-released the original.
However, I is a little disappointed about dis movie.
Somehow it seems to be aimed at US audience, there just was too much jokes that was heard and seen before.
First, Bacon decides to get revenge with little preparation.
Second, he goes from a bundled up neurotic basket-case white collar worker and then becomes "Jason Bourne." Third, if that isn't enough, the bad guy thugs shoot him and obviously everyone in the theater can see he's only winged and "they" leave him while exiting the house with nary a cop in sight while a patrol car sits out front with two murdered officers leaning on a horn blaring away.
Where are the back-up?
Then good 'ol Kevin escapes the hospital with great ease not to mention heading back to his house and several other places to prepare for his assault on the bad boys lair.
This is only a smidgen of several "beyond belief" scenarios that just frustrated the heck out of me.
Lastly, I felt betrayed by the ending that left questions unanswered.
The only problem is how the pieces all fall into place relatively with little effort or dismay considering how her fiancée was killed and all and how they come to accept the flaky 'other woman' with barely a ruffle of feathers.
However the film's final moment feels like a cop out and not an entirely believable close to an otherwise unnerving, nasty slice of the American Dream becoming the American Nightmare.
The reason for Carver's intent is not revealed until the final act (which is the weaker part of the film) but consider its post-Civil War thread and that should sate those who don't want a spoiler thrown in for good measure.
... Weaknesses:Very poor wi-fi range.
Had to get within 10 feet of a 14db gain antenna to have a consistent useable signal.
Display cracked after two days.
No warranty on display.
Neither PalmOne or the merchant will warranty the display.
I only had a short time to use the unit.
After haggling with both for several days only to finally find that it was going to cost $125, I was forced to have the credit card company charge-back the purchase.
Considering Palmone's lack of customer support and English as a second language staff, I would not recommend the purchase of this PDA.
I really wish I hadn't.
The selection of widgets available on the TV are poor, and limited.
Most apply to the US (weather, sports news).
Let me satisfy that curiosity for you - as the service stands - don't waste your money.
You've been warned.
PS there is a Sudoku widget - so you can play Sudoku on the TV (as I said ealier - don't waste your money).
I managed to network two Mac desktops, an iBook, a Windows laptop, an all-in-one printer/scanner and a PS2 without any problems, except setting up the Windows wireless, but even that connected to the Macs on the network.
This Linksys just didn't want to play.
I ended up having to manually configure everything just to get the iBook to see the router, then get it on the 'Net, using wires and wireless.
If you have Macs and need them networked over a cable broadband connection look for another Mac-friendly router or be prepared to get your hands dirty typing in IP and DNS addresses.
Hopefully now it is running I won't need to do that again, and getting the other machines connected will be easier.
I had a lot of problems with it accepting my DVD disks which play with no problems on my computer's DVD player which I'm sure is a cheaper player by far.
I noticed that the unit couldn't recognize the markers from my computer's DVD bookmarks and the AB repeat works horribly.
It works, but it freezes the picture for about 3-4 seconds before starting over which, again, my computer's DVD player does seamlessly.
I expected the unit to far surpass my computer's DVD player and it doesn't.
I am returning the unit to the store and looking for a better replacement.
It quit working just two days ago, so i called Lexmark support and they had me clean the rollers, but this did'nt work.
so i went on-line to check on my warranty and that is all i could seem to do.
Could not find any where to put in a claim.
I am very upset, but i am not a quitter but a surviver ! I am going to keep on trying, they will definitely remember my name before i am through.
But the headset is huge - it doesnt fit into my ears - none of them, and believe me - both of my ears are of generous size!
:) It doesn't fit into my son's and friend's ears as well - keeps falling out.
And the sound quality - my God!
People I've been talking to were always complaining about low volume (they had it maxed on their receivers) and strange rustling and swishing noise.
I've heard them better, but far away from good.
If I could, I would like to return it or exchange for something better.
But everything positive thing about it is completely negated by one thing: ... Cons: When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functionality is disabled.Scanner will not work unless all ink tanks are at acceptable levels.
When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functions are disabled.
You are not allowed to use the scanner if any single cartridge is empty.
I cannot think of a more retarded feature...
this is a complete, utter, and absolute failure on Canon's part to create a decent product.
I don't print very often, and I am not about to go shell out another 40 of 50 dollars on ink just so I can scan a drawing of mine.
HP all-in-ones don't seem to have this problem.
Buy one of them instead.
Anyway, as soon as I strapped these things on, I realized that I made a big mistake.
It's awful!
The band that goes around the back of your head is not adjustable, and if you are wearing a collar of any sort, when you move your head at all, it will rub and move the ear buds in and out of your ears.
If you want a headset for the gym like I do, then stay away from these - unless you have a head the size of Shrek. The ring around the back of your head that connects the earpieces is about 2 full inches from your head/neck.
Terrible design.
A few months after using it, it stopped RAIDing across automatically.
When I called them to solve this problem, it was horrible.
They told me to download the newest firmware and helpfully sent me to a link to an iso image which didn't work.
When I called their support 5, yes, 5 times to solve just upgrading the firmware, they told me first that the iso was fine, then to use a boot diskette, then to use the iso.
Not to mention the link they provided was to the 9650 not the 9550. Finally when I upgraded the firmware and it didn't solve the issue, I was sent to "level 3" support.
I don't mind dealing with pearl scripts, but it wasn't supported and he wouldn't tell me anything about what the script did, so it wasn't that helpful.
Later trying to decide what to do about this problem, I realized that this was a malfunctioning product and they they should take it back.
I called to return the product because it had a bug in it and was sent somewhere else, the people I was sent to wouldn't admit that it had a bug in the card, but I could return the product and get another buggy 9550 SUX (SXU 4LP).
Is this the way 3ware builds their business?
I could have purchased a sub $100 card and received better results.
I won't be purchasing from 3ware again.
The display is plain manual is quite complex.
I did have issues with sound from my TV as well.
When the station would change from commercials to shows or vise versa, the sound would cut out on some.
The television itself would have sound, but the receiver had none.
I took it back and got a Harmon/Kardon (AVR-247)for the same price and I feel it blows this one away.
It has a much more modern look and is much more user friendly.
Since I use reference material often at my work, this is an extreme disappointment...
Also might be nice to have relative pointing instead of absolute...
sometimes reaching the top of the tablet to reach the top of the screen is tiring (as someone with limited mobility).
They were alot smaller than it seemed in the pictures.
They seemed really flimsy, even though they were the 25th anniversary edition which was a contributing factor for me returning them.
Cons: Horrible quality.
Scratches way too easily.
But then I started to pick out all the bad things about it.
-The camera shutter sound does not turn off, so even if your phone is on silent, if the camera button gets pressed, your phone makes an annoying noise.
-The speaker phone is very quiet.
- The phone scratches very easily and does not handle being dropped very well.
I drop mine once and ever since its made this horrible buzzing noise.
-The main reason I am getting rid of this phone is because of the charging/charger/battery.
Around the second month I had this phone, the charger broke.
When I went to charge it, it would charge for a few minutes, and then stop.
Now it wont charge at all.
This phone is reasonably priced, but the quality is terrible.
Now the bad news: It is true that Gateway's customer service is not helpful if there are problems.
The instruction manual states that when transferring pictures from the camera to the computer, you should use an AC adapter that does not come with the camera, but which is available in the "Gateway Digital Camera Accessory Kit." Good luck finding such a kit!
First I went to Radio Shack, they didn't have the kit, and had no adapter that would fit the camera.
Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.
They said they longer keep the accessory kit in stock, but that I should be able to get it in any electronics store.
Yeah, right.
So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.
That was about 2 months ago, and I still haven't heard from Gateway.
The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.
When using the zoom, I find that you must have extremely steady hands when taking the pictures or you will get blurred shots.
This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.
You must press the button down rather hard before it responds.
If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
The Bottom Line: If you are interested in purchasing a DVD/VCR combo player, I would recommend a different brand due to Sony's exchange policy and horrible service.
I previously posted the following review of this player: "My Sony D500P arrived yesterday, and I tried two different DVDs, but both played poorly.
Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
I guess not!"
The dealer informed me that Sony had instituted a new policy requiring that all exchanges have to be directly through Sony. I thought this was hard to believe, and called Sony. Sony confirmed that in fact, this is their policy.
They also refused to pay the postage for the return.
I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.
A week later, still no replacement unit.
I called Sony again, and again the first agent said it was already sent, then after I explained it hadn't arrived I was transferred to the second department, which again confirmed it hadn't been sent out yet.
I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.
The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
On the other hand, I would not recommend this or any other Sony product in light of Sony's exchange policy and poor service.
The one thing I really don't like about the Terk FDTV2A is that none of the cables and cords can be easily replaced.
The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.
The power cable (AC adapter) is similarly integrated into the amplifier.
If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.
If you needed to lengthen the coaxial cable, you could use a female-to-female barrel connector, but I assume you would start degrading your signal at some point.
This whole design seems to create an unnecessary rat's nest of wires behind my television.
Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.
The issue is the online interface.
It is almost too simple and lacks preferences or options.
You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.
Sometimes information is unable to be acquired.
...Cons: Gets very hot.
Very expensive compared to others.
When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
It really doesn't.
... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
The real disappointment here is the build quality.
I've never used a Canon product that felt so shoddy.
An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
While that could be overlooked in a Happy Meal toy, this is a $400 camera.
It seems I may have used the flash accidentally once or twice (I keep it off) but if I depended on it I might be a little wary of its constant popping up as I'm sure its just a flimsy, plastic rack and pinion mechanism.
The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot...the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below, or shooting one-handed.
As I keep it off when I'm not shooting it does take a bit longer than feels necessary to start up and auto-focus when I want shoot: maybe 3-4 secs or so.
Sadly, these were the only tracks worth any attention.
The songs really never come to life.
I tried several times listening to the album, hoping I would get it, but no, this is for me an album that lacked a creative spark, something I can't say about anything else I had heard by Neil Finn (his next studio album, live album and recent one with his brother are for example much better).
Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
Their reaction to this album was, however, almost identical to mine, close to being boring and not living up to expectations.
It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it.
My advice, however, is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn.
I have PURCHASED every album since 1993, so I feel I speak with some authority when I say that this album is by far the worst yet.
"Stand up" stinks up the joint from the cover art (what is that goofy concept lady?), to the tiny tiny song labels on the back.
Oh yeah, and the music is lame, with 3-4 exceptions.
I won't even address the copy protection issue...that's been done to death, and I agree with them all.
I encourage you to buy this cd....my copy is available.
This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.
First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.
It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).
The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.
Don't buy or rent this DVD
This cd was horrible.
I did not like any of the songs.
they changed all there great songs into bad ballads.
Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.
I threw away the cd after listening to 2 songs.
don't buy this cd it is a waste of good money
I really hate to say it, because i think Ani Difranco is awesome, but this album is very bad.
At best, it sounds like some cleaned up B-Sides. She probably should have worked hard on a few songs rather than not putting very much into all of the songs on this album.
I tried to like this album, and it's definently hard admitting it to myself that Ani put out a bad album, but she has.
This album more or less sucks.
None of the songs stand out from each other.
They all sound like experiments that weren't seen through from start to finish.
Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.
On this one they're just depressed.
Looking over the lyric sheet it appears he's written the same song over and over again for three albums.
Don't waste your money on this.
This is the worst VH album of all time.
Even Van Halen 3 is better than this.
Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?)
and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now.
The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.
Now, they changed for the sake of nothing.
They're gone.
the cure song is total rubbish...
perhaps the reason robert smith had to do the song all by his lonesome: the other members openly hate DM... in fact, even smith has made it a habit to rip on DM for many years...
then he goes out and does something stupid like record this song...
for shame...
but i've never been impressed with DM, in the slightest...
again, the cure song sux...
the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
First of all, the bass player...fat pocket, this guy must wear big raver pants, because he has such fat pocket.
I am thinking, Kik Wear, Sonic 2000, the ones that are bright pink.
So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
Um, the guitar player, you can tell he has fat pockets too, and fat licks.
But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
I don't know, I think he still is pretty putrid.
And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.
Oh my gosh, and he always is mixing it up, from hi hat to ride cymbal, dang, it's so chopped I don't even know what kind of meat he is flavoring!!!
Um, and that one guy that wrote the review that says, "these guys are mega wicked chill" um, I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani, because your pockets are so tight, and I don't even think you know what you're talking about.
I don't think so.
Perhaps I'm jaded, but now much of this album sounds pretty silly (as does a lot of the music I proudly own from that era).
What's with the rest of this junk?
It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring.
I do not have the 2 channel SACD to use for comparison but I do have the regular remastered CD. This mix presents a wildly un-musical, psychedelic=like four channel guitar panning, throwing Carlos' guitar solos all over the place.
In is a little unsettling.
But the first thing you will notice on BLACK MAGIC WOMAN is that the .1 channel is almost non-existent.
Gone is the wonderfully fat bass line, especially those G's (G1 on your piano keyboard).
Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.
It's like listening to Santana perform and having the bassist playing about 20 feet behind them with his amp turned down really low.
In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
But three in a bed make "country music," and it tastes nothing like Bragg or Guthrie--maybe more Wilco than Willie Nelson. What do I mean?
Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me.
If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or "Sexuality" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy.
...but "A Night at the Opera" just doesn't do it for me.
The rest of the album relies too heavily on multi-tracked vocals, which bring the album's overall appeal down for me.
The main problem was that none of the songs were being performed live.
The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
It took me not a whole lot longer than zero seconds to realize that something was wrong.
The starting crushing interplay of bass & drums on Come Back and Stay is nowhere to be heard, the songs simply "starts".
When I heard that the middle section where Paul sings "Since You've Been Gone...." is truncated did I realize that this is the single version being used, NOT the original album version.
Things get worse: Love Will Tear Us Apart is presented here without the intro on the original album, again it simply "starts".
Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.
In whole, a major disappointment due to shortened versions, and simply baffling since it is stated that this IS the original album.
I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.
My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...
I don't really feel for this one.
When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation.
The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring.
This game gets dull very fast since you'll find yourself racing one competition event over and over to earn just enough money to buy that extra engine part that you want.
If you want a fast paced, fun, exciting, and non-repetitive game, then get Burnout 2 or Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. These two games have a lot more different game modes that will keep you busy for hours while your Gran Turismo 3 sits on the shelf.
After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious.
Every game seems to have 10 or so "intro" screens that you have to go through.
To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens.
Some require pushing A, others you have to select options with the cursor then click A, others require jumping to get a random dice roll.
Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again.
Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
The graphics are not all that great.
The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.
Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.
Like the injector that heals you, which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself.
This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't using the damn thing every 10 seconds.
Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again.
What's the point of that?
If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.
Also the multiplayer sucks, blow up gold crates....
I hear they are releasing new modes, but who cares when the game play is this bad.
Anyways, maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4. But it feels like they rushed this game out.
I recommend that you keep your money and wait for the really good games this fall.
This was a ripoff.
The missions are dark and pretty dull.
There is hardly any new competitive multiplayer content.
3 maps...
Wow, could have been a expansion pack.
I don't understand why they would make a new game with no improvements.
If anything this is a crappy version of Halo 3 that comes with a Halo 3 multiplayer disk...
way to go Bungie. Thats a shame, I had high hopes for this game.
This is the worst game I have ever played.
The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
The rest is going forward mindlessly shooting at braindead monsters that dance forward and backwards.
( Like in any House of the Dead game ) nothing else.
How this is considered the best game of all times is beyond me.
Of all my purchases, ( that include text-only games ) this is the one that I most regret.
The only reason I give it a 1 is because of the graphics, just as another review stated: terrible game with nice coat of paint to hide it's rust.
That's about all it amounts too, and again on that same review it's more then likely due to buying out any possibility of competition.
It was becoming too much for EA Sports to take with the annual humiliation from the up-start 2K Sports so they just bought the NFL rights to creating football video games.
That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...
can't beat 'em so buy out the rights to make it at all???
Yeah, you really showed them...
EA Sports aren't Gods of anything...
they're ruthless dictators with no ba11s.
"Disastrous" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.
Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on.
I don't think the creators could have done a worse job and honestly I hope SouthPeak doesn't get the option to make any more games.
Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments.
STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!
I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks "realistic" or because it looks like a "simulation" might be deterred.
The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things: You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences (huh?), haybails, and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad.
This is all in a game which claims to let you use "Real Military Tactics."
Ridiculous stuff.
The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?
Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.
The rare gully and stone wall or rock is really your only option for "real" cover, but the game more or less expects you to use the haybails to hide behind when a German with an MP40 is shooting at you.
I would LOVE to know what was going through the minds of the designers for Brothers In Arms when it comes to that portion of the game.
Come on - you don't have to be a genius to note that an MG42 is going to tear a wooden fence to bits and pieces, so why would the majority of the cover provided be thin wood or tin?
No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.
I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.
Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a "simple" game.
It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet...
I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.
Needless to say, I feel very let down.
I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.
I doubt the producers have ever been to it.
And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game?
It also puzzles me about the character selection because nobody has high speed or anything so there is really no need.
Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.
GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics, but this sadly will remind you of the chunky, low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64. As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube (but then I played Star Fox Adventures).
Like when you try cuddle Frankenstien, you don't cuddle him, you get impaled on his arm and you get 200 points or so (you would expect it to subtract points wouldn't you?)
and then the controller unexpectedly rumbles.
I also went right through a bench once.
And I also find myself running through a lot of people.
MUSIC & SOUND EFFECTS 0/10 The starting music is mute pressing material and when you get into the actual game, it does not change.
It is impossible to survive the music, even though there is very little of it, when it happens you will be sorry that you did not mute.
It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.
GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!
The gameplay is not worthy of anything.
There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
''). And you earn points for things that you don't even see.
They tried to make a good item system, but they unfortunately failed, and quite miserably may I add?
The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.
It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.
Neither, I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps.
If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
Unfortunately the game lacks substance.
The music is horrible and I am not one to even mention the music.
The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
So with all this negativity, it looks like I foolishly wasted $30 dollars to get this mediocre game shipped to me, especially already knowing that it lacked.
I haven't completed legend mode(defend the belt 7 times) but after that I think it will collect dust.
I can't recommend this game even if you are a big UFC fan like myself.
"Total letdown" Let me just clear some things up first.
This game is NOT the real Ninja Council 3, it's actually the 4th version in Japan. Since this game has no story at all, D3 decided to take Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu 4 and modify it to be in line with the American dub of Naruto. If you're fimiliar with the previous versions of Ninja Council, prepare to be disappointed big time.
This game is a very dumbed down version of that game (which also features Naruto as a playable character) you only attack with ONE button making it a easy game to play.
This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.
To make things worse, Tomy added alot of playable characters from the anime in this game, it's too bad all of them play EXACTLY the same.
Another thing that might piss you off is how broken this game is.
You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.
I recommend neither.
Not only is this game an embarrassment and rip-off, it was created for the sole purpose of making a quick buck off Naruto fans.
Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.
For the first 20 minutes.
When playing alone, SSBB loses it's value quickly.
At that point it only holds up as one of those games that's only fun with other people(*cough*Mario Party*cough*). Sadly SSBB eventually loses it's fun factor when it comes to multiplayer, too.
~Gameplay: 3/10~ SSBB gameplay is good for the first day and a half, after that it drops dead faster than you can say "let down."
Playing through adventure to unlock stuff gets really tedious, as it's LONG. So does event mode.
That's it for 51 whole events!?
What a waste of time.
Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
So sad......
Smash Bros. games are expected to have a perfect replay value, but this one's longevity is INCREDIBLY low.
Thus bringing the score down.
Way down.
If your not, then you won't.
This game is barely worth a rent, because you'll lose interest quick.
"Disappointing" This game ain't as good as the other 2D Sonic games This game is originally for the Sega CD then I found out this game was ported to PC. Even though I rarely play games on my PC I went to order this on EBay then I got it a days later then got around to playing it and I was dissapoint!
It's just lacking something.
Maybe it's the level designs' cheapness.
It is really annoying how cheap this and some places take pure luck to beat.
For the music part the music is pretty weird too.
Their certainly is better Sonic games out their.
Well, let's see...For starters, the pacing of the game is very uneven.
You'll often find yourself trapped in a closed arena withhordes of monsters, just needing to find the right combination of Legions (your demonic partners in this game) to kill 'em all and move on.
Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.
This sort of stop-and-go fighting takes away from the sense of danger that a game like this is supposed to have.
The graphics don't do this game justice, either.
But since you can only upgrade your Legions between levels, and it takes such a ridiculous amount of EXP to earn even the most basic of upgrades, it hardly seems worth it in the end.
Everyone else should steer clear.
The Aiming feature has yet to be desired however.
I found the cross hairs a little too sensitive and the amount of time between checkpoints too long.
Nothing like spending 10minutes blasting through soldiers then all of a sudden when your about to hit the end you get jumped by 3 soldiers out of nowhere and you have to start 10 minutes back and do everything all over again.
But this game is way too long and repetitious.
It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.
Some of the chapters are extremely difficult where you have to kill hundreds of aliens before you get to save the game at a checkpoint.
If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ... I recommend playing this game at the "normal" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun.
The game has very blocky graphics bringing down its overall appeal.
The character models and karts are especially blocky, while the worlds are alright, but have only been slightly touched up from the N64 version.
In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.
Sadly, some aspects of the multiplayer require you to unlock battle modes and things of that nature.
The game seems as if it merely copied of Mario Kart DS at parts.
Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
The story is old, you gain all of your Brothers then you lose them, then you gain them back.
Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.
If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.
Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.
The towns, castles, and dungeons look just as real as the ones from FF 7 and FF 8. This makes the characters look out of place--especially in FMV sequences--because the characters are deformed looking.
Character themes are mellow and boring.
Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.
It is about a boy named Vivi who doesn't know anything about his past and spends the whole game discovering the exact same things that Terra and Cloud discovered in Final Fantasy 6 and 7. Oh, and Garnet also discovers her past through a series of flashbacks that establish her as something that we the player already knew from the first few hours of playing the game.
Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.
He has no depth.
Zidane seems thrown into the game as a marketing tool to entertain the 13 year old boys who will be purchasing this game.
Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.
Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).
Quin is of course the Gogo character, only stupider.
The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.
Princess Garnet (aka Dagger), in Square tradition, is the magic using chick that was born from some special summoner race, yatta yatta.
You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.
Dagger just simply exists in this title, and is so predictable, that her story could have been summed up in about 20 minutes of the game.
Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.
Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
Unfortunately, the ATEs add so little to the game that they almost interrupt the game when they occur so frequently.
There really isn't anything to the main character, which is unfortunate since we spend so much time with him.
Since he is a thief, why not make him more devious.
Why not expand more on that story to give his character more of an edge: making him distrustful, perhaps bitter, or even insecure.
None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.
The Villian is a total rehash of FF6 and FF7. His character is pointless and arbitrary to the game as a whole.
He is thrown in to give us a villian.
There is no real motive behind his evil, and he starts out as a powerful almost indestructible god.
This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.
Why not just alert the player by saying ''Hi, I'm going to be the last boss in this game, or at least one of the last bosses.''
Square's ''old school'' attempts went to waste since there really wasn't anything ''old school'' about this game--not plot wise anyway.
As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.
And speaking of battles, this game is one of the easiest Final Fantasies ever.
Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
Level gaining is quick, and irrelevant since it seems to not matter what level the party is at.
What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?
This makes the game way too easy.
Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.
Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
When the game is over, you feel numb, as if you have watched 3 Disney movies in a row.
The game could essentially pass as a Disney movie.
This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.
The whole ''the crystals are back thing'' sounded nice...except that you don't bother with crystals until disc 3! The characters were beyond cliche, beyond trite, they were flat, like cardboard cut outs, or movie extras.
The story was poorly developed and executed.
At least Final Fantasy VIII gave us characters that we could focus on.
At least Squall had an angle to him.
Hell, even Cloud, the soldier who barely talked and had no recollection of the past seemed more real than any of the characters in FF9. I guess the only thing ''old school'' about this game was the lack of plot.
Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.
Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
All in all, I hope Square tries a little harder next time.
This game could have been prevented.
I wish I hadn't bought this game, and so will you.
No, since it's almost a brand-new game, they put so much new features that if you didn't like the old one, you're almost sure to put it in your top ten games after trying it.
However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.
I'ma really huge Harvest Moon fan, but this one really disappointed me.
Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.
In this game, they took off all that fun stuff that made the game somehow special.
This is what gives Harvest Moon games a little something special, and they took it all off!
The only ones you can interact with are the little harvest sprites, located right under your shed.
However, they almost always say the same phrase everyday, and they're not very talkative (…). As for the mountain, there is simply none!
The village still exists, of course, but you can only go shopping there: the shopkeepers are only “pictures”, not persons, and you can't move around in the shop.
All you see is the counter with the produces on display and the shopkeeper in front of you.
There are still 5-6 festivals, but all you can do to participate is to talk to the shopkeepers (only way you can interact with them, but they always say the same things).
At your farm, the only place (beside festivals) you can move around, all you do is care about your farm.
You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time, which is not much.
This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
Still, as good they may be, the cows really look bad in this game.
Score: 9/10 Music– In one word: repetitive!!
The spring and winter musics will get on your nerves when you hear them; they're slow!
If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moons…
I don't know, give us something nice to hear, that makes you want to move around!
With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing over…and over…and…………over!!
Whatever the season, the music, you will get sick to hear it, so take off the sound on your Gameboy, choose one of your favourite songs, find a CD player and enjoy good music while playing the game!
Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
it's not a good game.
But if you have money for one more HM, don't buy this one, it's the worst of them all.
Compared to the other HM, it's no good.
The sound is also a let down because you can hear the enemies uttering similar remarks throughout the game - sometimes giving away their position.
some units arnet up to scratch however.
Value Seems very long, but the campain can get a bit boring, those videos really get on your nerves aswell.
Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games, that AI is weak.
I'll admit the plotline sucked, the guns feel weak, and the worlds kind of boring.
However, towards the end of the game the graphics start to suck.
The cities are all dark; I suppose from smog and smoke from guns, and cannons, ect.
However, at this point in the game, the draw distances become smaller, and the game looks just about as good as it did on the ps2.
Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.
You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4. Racing missions are just annoying.
I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again.
Sometimes there are cheap deaths.
For example, 30 guys with RPG's will shoot at you all at once.
Maps to big.
There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
The graphics are the only flaw.
The background are bland.
And the frame chugs every so often.
The Bad: As of May 2009, there are still critical bugs left in the game.
Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.
Not enough bugs that I wouldn't recommend to buy it, based on the fact that it works fairly well for me.
I was a first year AP US teacher when I purchased this book and another by the Princeton Review. Both books are intended to be complete resources for reviewing for the AP Exam, but the Princeton Review is substantially better in all areas.
The selling point (I thought) in the REA book was the "Six full length practice exams" it advertises.
Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
Most only require the student to know a definition.
The essay questions are acceptable, but instead of explaining different approaches to writing the essay and evaluating the sources (like the Princeton Review) this book simply gives example essays.
The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy.
Better yet, get yourself the Princeton Review book!
It was terrible.
I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.
Let me substantiate my claim: 1. It is historically inaccurate.
It is not historical fiction, it is fiction.
2. The shallowness of the characters made me cringe.
As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.
The 100+ positive reviews of this book mortified me.
3. The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader.
Again, I was outraged.
4. (NB: I am neither a Jew nor an Arab) It sickens me to see the gross racial prejudice of the author.
This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism', in Exodus, all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being, while the heroic, courageous, morally upright, (superior race!)
Jews lead an epic battle for the land that is rightfully theirs: just like the Germans did in 1939 against the 'evil' and 'inferior' Polish who were occupying 'their' land.
It won't taste nice, and its a bore.
Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page.
Many of Frymire's conclusions are naive, and a large number are just plain wrong as will be obvious to any creationists.
The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
In short this book will do more harm than good.
The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.
By flagrantly violating narrative intrusion, making it obvious to the reader and by claiming that she believes herself to be an actual blood descendant of Mary Magdalene and that this is all some fictionalized recounting of events that she alleges have happened to her, she shows that she just doesn't get it.
It's not all about ME!
Secondly, I found myself distracted by the ham-handed writing quality.
But the Oh, my gosh!
factor was crippled by giving away too much too soon.
I'd easily figured out what the puzzle was before turning the page.
Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!
First of all, it is open to anybody, not just scientists, to show that materialism it not a complete explanation.
And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.
Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.
Any sensible understanding should begin at the bottom (simple repeated experiments), and Behe does not demonstrate that a non-materialist explanation is necessary.
Until he, or anyone else, can do so, it is a waste of time to argue about intelligent design.
This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.
The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
How deeply disturbing that a book such as this could be published by a respectable publisher, endorsed by anthropologists, and even be nominated for a National Book Award. If Tierney was just honestly presenting evidence of wrongdoing, that would be fine.
He distorts his printed sources, omits evidence in these sources that refutes his accusations, and invents material that isn't actually there (there are currently many web sites which document this dishonesty in a point-by-point manner, although Amazon asks that reviewers not include URLs in their reviews).
And that's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend (mission records, interviews, audio tapes, etc.). In fact, several of Tierney's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully.
What a hoot!
Quaint, presumptuous, full of fluff, and non-stop kookery.
Magnetism is personal power and the author's treatise on how to attain it is total bunk peppered with pseudo-science.
There's even a chapter about developing a "magnetic eye!"
I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
Her true intention of her mission is to achieve closure before starting her new life, marrying her love Randy. Her story is too long and drawn out.
Many details and explanations are left out.
Mostly shallow ideas about meaning of life.
But fall short and aren't justified by argument or stories.
He says things everyone else says who is dying, and what we all know to be true about death and living well.
He also says plenty of wrong stuff.
He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
No story.
Narrator is impossible to sympathize with; he chased money and worldly success and is now reconsidering.
Well, duh, that summarizes just about every bad story ever told.
He has aparently been in Vietnam which is great, but being a soldier doesn't make you a poet.
But really...
I mean really...
it's exactly as South Park so poignantly described it.
I mean the title alone is so apropos.
However as an adult, I don't get why so many adults like this series.
The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.
Potter in the movies is that type of hero, choosing to stand by, honoring the words of his teacher, however Potter in the books is trapped and can't move so instead of choosing he just accepts, he's left with all the choices taken away from him.
I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.
It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.
The superior attitude and preachy tone works against their message, though.
Why be so snarky towards such easy targets as the vegan starlet?
Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.
I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.
But I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: don't read it in this edition!
It's not just the footnotes, some of which were reprinted, some of which weren't.
The trouble is that "Book 1: Production", is missing completely.
That's a fifth of the whole text!
If you like it, by all means buy a paper edition -- but not this one!
I was EXTREMELY disappointed when he didn't name any of them.
Some may find that concept hard to buy, especially if they don't even own a pair of boots.
Weak points * The book assumed you knew either a) other authors and references, or b) what different theories (such as JPED) were.
* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.
I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information.
* I wish there would have been more talk of the archaeological records.
* I wanted to see a chapter written by Kevin Vanhoozer.
The only place I found this book lacking was in the "spiritual content" department.
The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
The graphic images from "The Horror of It" seem tame by today's standards.
The titles subtext of "Anti-war classic" is a bit misleading.
This one is actually the worst and the most sensless movie I have ever gone to a theater for.
I was extremely disappointed.
But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
This mpvie is the pits..
If you thought PULSE was bad, OOOH just you wait!
They made a sequel!
If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
If acting was a draw- back, then understanding what they where talking about was another story.
It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen, where the backdrop...
well looked as fake as it was....
While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another, the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion.
Even though I didn't LIKE the first movie, this one just sets another bar!
To add, the plot is TERRIBLE, and questionable.
And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...
And the naked girl....
obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.
Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.
The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first.
Until I saw the movie!
Everything in between is a bunch of garbage.
But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after.
I mean, are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth?
People lose their last Baby-Tooth every day, but it is never explained in this movie why this Tooth-Fairy hasn't paid deadly visits to others throughout the world.
The little kid, who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning, is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult.
Personally, I don't think they should make horror films that are rated either PG or PG-13. What sort of audience are they trying to appeal to when they green-light a slasher with zero gore?
Clearly the only goal of this PG horror was to attract children and depart them from their lunch-money by turning a childhood memory into a monster.
It only sounded like a good idea, but the finished product gave me a tooth-ache.
But I hate it since I had to pay 8 bucks for something that should have been a SCI-FI, USA or an ABC movie of the week.
As a theatrical movie, I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.
I gave this film a 2/10. A point for the only two good scenes in this film.
But those two scenes are not worth the quarter that the Tooth Fairy leaves beneath your child's pillow.
This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me!
This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line.
They also skipped many important events like Eragon's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head.
He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?
No? Didn't think so!
Oh, and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding (and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure) Oh yeah, back to the smoke monster, it was never in the book!
What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
Eddie Murphy's latest and now this..."Hannibal meets Homer Simpson".
Actually I hate to demean Homer. Well, lets hope there's someone out there that can bring Hollywood out of this quagmire of dull, over killed, underachieved and discombobulated pile of, what did I call it?
Friday The 13th Part 29! Ditto to johnny 1504 by the way.
Ruining a classic should be against the law.
Fox...shame on you.
Not even close.
Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
Great remakes are few and rare.
After today's waste of time & money I have to agree.
Now let's talk about the flaws.
Keanu was so one dimensional that it became boring.
What ever you were paid it was undeserved.
The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision.
Why the alien has arrived and why the earth is in peril is a slap in the face compared to the classic motive set forth in the original.
Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.
It is very much like the way the 51' movie portrayed them.
Gort (the ominous almost limitless of powers guardian of the world) fell far short of taking this film to heights that it could have achieved.
Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit.
Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes.
What I've learned now is...Don't get your hopes up.
It just ain't worth it.
After the heated opening and things settle down from all the hoop-la even sane Star Wars addicts will admit that the acting & dialog were painful to endure.
Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great.
Nichole was the only saving grace to this (simply put) FLOP!!
I doubt if they see just how bad an actor Will Ferrell and how over the top his shenanigans become "overkill".
I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.
Twists that just don't click.
I was in the midst of wondering why I was watching this 3rd rate film when I could have been watching "Dear John" instead.
Not every film is a "10" but Lord please spare me the 1 thru 3's.
I'm to old to waste time.
DVD should have been much better as well.
No deleted scenes & I had trouble accessing some items.
I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.
I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene.
They were extremely short and some were even useless...
The director sets the entire plot of the movie on about 10 minutes, the rest is just there to fill in the other 97 minutes.
I left the movie theatre wodering what the hell happened when they were in there?
there are a LOT of plot holes.
As for Jeremy Irons... I don't really want to go there.
I'm very fond of his previous work and I really think that he couldn't have played a worse Profion even if he had tried.
Then there's Thora Birch... who I would like to nominate as this years Jar Jar Blinks... it's difficult to think this is the same person from "American Beauty" The character development is another big mess!
Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
they are sharing the most passionate love story you can ever imagine.
Plus Ridley (who's name is all the information we get from him) is suddenly very unaware of how "gifted" he is, and is choosen out of the blue to save the universe.
Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
When the actors are speaking I would like to see their faces, so I can understand the dialogue.
The camera was so often in the background I felt like I was eavesdropping on the conversations instead of in on the conversations.
Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.
Then, on the other hand, the longest close-ups, of Ralph Fiennes' face, lingered so long and so pointlessly.
I knew right from the start that this was going to be over the top and not that interesting really.
Since I'm studying philosophy at the university I've found it quite interesting to laugh out load at the symbolism in The Matrix series.
The names are the worst part of these films, "The Logos", "The Hammer", "Smith", "Morpheus", "Trinity" and so on.
These are just icons symbolising that Andy and Larry has opened the Great Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Religion and just cramed it all together.
Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
Lines like "It's Latin, it means 'Know thy self'", screams of un-intelligens, it was of course not Latin but ancient greek since the temple that said it was located in Delphi which is in Greece and not Italy. And no onward to the films.
And that's what this film is about, nodding to the first film since it now seems a life-time away that these brothers can do something even resembling interesting.
We have the black cat, lousy score, the Trinity kick, the oracles home (with her in it), cookies, and so on.
They are of course crap, is this what we pay for?
Crap! We will of course see the next film in the series.
When will this stop, when can they put more out of that production-value into the films, it says here in the Trivia-section they spent 2 months working on a raindrop, why couldn't they spend that time re-working the script I ask?
This is just a complete disaster from top to bottom.
Unfortunately, the answer is a definitive no. A bland script coupled with a less than engaging plot overshadows its CG and musical flare.
Sadly though, the negative aspects of AV are too glaring to ignore.
The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.
While I know this is the nature of any magical world, it's overdone to the point of distracting the viewer.
But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.
To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.
The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.
Adding insult to injury, staple characters of the game such as Barret and antagonist Sephiroth are given little screen time.
What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.
Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical "going no where" hubbub.
I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.
Jessica alba wasn't all that great though.
The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.
If you can surmount that disappointment, it should be noted that the studio clips are mostly of extremely poor quality (as if photographed from a tv screen).
On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).
I found such effects distracting and annoying.
On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).
All stones were left unturned.
While director Louis Leterrier attempts to give the old-school flick a 21st century CGI kick in the pants (and odes to Ray Harryhausen's original creatures featured particularly the gi-normous scorpion battle royale) the script by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay & Matt Manredi is stilted to the wooden proceedings at hand.
Also: don't be fooled; even though this was re-processed for a 3-D release there is practically no 3-D effects at all!
1. Dreadful to set up - the claim about wizard guide was of limited use after setting up the base unit, and I had to get a good friend to spend several hours doing for me.
2. The claims about "up to 500% more wireless coverage" did not translate into a much improved signal for my remote computers - I only saw very marginal improvement on the prior Netgear router I was using!
3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart "internal" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.
Now the bad part: The closures (plastic snappers) are of very cheap plastic.
They broke after only a few times using it, just by normal open and closing.
(Careful handled and not over loaded).The bag is unusable and worthless without them....
Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do.
This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.
This bag would be great if they would just spend two dollars more for a better closure.
As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.
Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.
It's now April 2010 and for over 6 months now, [...] has yet to get this ish together.
The site totally sucks.
If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.
You're not able to search for your friends, sync your email contacts, you get errors when syncing in with facebook and twitter.
It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?
For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.
Seems like everyone is getting these issues.
It is not the carrier's service, it is the phone.
My T720 has broke down several times.
It will just turn itself off and will not turn back on.
I don't know from day to day if it will work or not.
I'll never buy another moto
purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
The steps to reach the file transfer are too complex and non exhistent(sp?).I found no company ph number on any of the product literature, the web site or yellow pages.com.
The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.
Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
I spent 3 days on and off trying to down load phone numbers from my motorola v600 cell phone to my laptop with the ambicom inc usb bluetooth adapter.
No luck & no support.
I will return this one and gladly pay more to get rid of this crap.
grainy photos, slow jerky movement.
But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.
Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.
Suddenly its my fault that parts of the program remain.
Also NOTE: Software that comes with camera includes BACKWEB - if you are unfamiliar with backweb - it is SPYWARE.
Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.
My real rating is -5 stars.
Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
For instance, there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up.
But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it won't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned.
The paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iPhone.
Very poor quality and design.
No wonder it is getting cheaper by the day.
Highly not recommend it.
This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.
This Virtual CD cannot be disabled, unmounted, removed, eradicated, or partitioned away - EVERY!!!!!
Western Digital has decided to embed their Virtual CD Smartware into this drive so that you cannot, under any circumstances, disable or remove the VCD. It will forever mount this unwanted intrusion to your Mac (Windows is no better apparently) and their website essentially tells you that you can do nothing about it.
Can you tell that I am upset?!?
I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.
If I were to buy more of these like I had planned, My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs. This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your "My Computer" window; but, on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable.
But, not with this new version (version 3?) of the My Book Essential Drives where it is embedded into the drive's hardware and cannot be deactivated.
Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.
Two things I don't like....1)the headset isn't very comfortable for longer calls--my ear starts to hurt if it's in for more than a few minutes.
2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings, and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.
And, thus, I wound up with blurry or dark pictures.
After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
Even in relatively good lighting conditions, it chose horrifying exposure times like 1/6 of a second.
??? In room lighting it even chose 1 second exposures!
It lets you adjust exposure + or -2, but the pics look terrible!
I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.
My pictures did NOT live up to ANY of my expectations.
I bought this camera on sale for $399 and hard a really hard time getting good pics out of the camera.
I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.
I bought a telephoto lens to see if that would help but it didn't.
The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.
I have two major complaints about this phone.
First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to "reboot" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone.
People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on.
I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.
If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.
Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.
But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.
Very disappointing.
Unfortunately, it lacks some capabilities a lot of ordinary Mac users will want - primarily the ability to sync data among multiple Macs. If you keep Bento on your desktop you can't readily sync its data to the same app on your laptop, or vice versa.
Makes it tough for use in a mixed environment.
This product works ok, but potential buyers should be aware of these issues: 1. The auto-orientation feature does not seem to work at all, despite me checking that it is enabled and resaving the settings several times.
All of my portrait photos were displayed on their side.
The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot, while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.
it was loud and incomparable.
Also, this accrued during normal usage (browsing, music) second, which was mostly the issue, the battery barely last 2 hours!
I could not get it to set the time automatically.
What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.
Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.
It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
And after that, she did not even bother to try out anything on my computer.
How could you not even try do get it to work on my current machine after spending so much time to get all the information out of me, I asked?
And I have to call you back on long-distance, and then wait forever to the muzak and then hope that you might authorize a replacement, I asked.
Yes, she replied curtly and hung up.
Getting it up for a Mac can take numerous hours and several phone calls to tech support.
It's pretty frustrating.
but clunky and slow as hell.
Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
not that its done it should be very quick, but 2 days???
I also noticed a marked slowdown on the machine with the active backup software monitoring in the background.
My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy.
Problems Encountered: Had one bad one that I had replaced.
There's no treble control on the unit.
Again a treble control would have been nice though.
I do have an issue with noise (especially when it is windy).
I also have excessive noise when I talk and have phone in my pocket while walking.
Please don't buy it...
The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.
It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
That said, this album is very poor.
Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
I realize that opinions vary, and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a negative review, but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.
Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music, and the beat gets lost in the background.
Even the remix of Southern Sun found in this collection is inferior to the original.
Also, many of these tracks are just filler or fluff, such as the James Bond Theme remix which is listed on the Amazon track list as: "9. James Bone Theme - Paul Oakenfold, Norman, Monty" James Bone Theme is about right.
I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself "You know what would be great?
Listening to some movie soundtrack remixes!"
It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
If you loved Tranceport, don't spend your money on this CD. If you loved Bunkka, don't spend your money either.
In this case, Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards, and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remixed are still relatively bad songs.
Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.
This a forgettable collection that only the most dedicated of Moby fans will want to purchase.
1.5/5 stars.
An uncommon misstep for Moby.
While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.
Maybe this was a bit harsh, but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash, maybe it wasn't punishment enough.
On "Dangerously In Love", she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands.
"Signs", co-written with Aaliyah's muse Missy Elliot, is a mess of nothing...driveling on about Astrology in a way that is neithor catchy nor creative.
But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be "Gift From Virgo"; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it.
The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch, about every 5 words or so we're hearing a new tune.
It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape, and is just as enjoyable.
The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is "Dangerously In Love", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica.
But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.
If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
Chingy's followup to 2003's "The Jackpot" falls disasterously lower than his debut.
Not many of the songs grabbed my attention, his voice gets real annoying after a while too.
Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.
It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.
Don't even waste your money.
Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.
a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
So obviously designed for kids, to allow them to shock mummy and daddy, i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records.
It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.
The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement, especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music, and not about their identities.
The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
As a whole, i would recomend bands such as Tool, AIC and other authentic metal rather than this sorry lot.
manufactured anger, for a manufactured audience.
And no kiddies, this is not being rebellious.
If this CD is "remastered", it certainly was not from the 1st generation, multi-track session tapes.
From listening to this CD, I can hear distortion and an audible amount of tape hiss, especially through the quiet passages of "I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face".
And after all these years, we STILL get "Mexican Shuffle" in MONO!
Which leads me to believe that this, and other TJB CD's in Herb Alpert's Signature Series, were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP's back in the 1960s (a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago, which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD).
In this day and age of today's advanced digital technology, a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the '60s, was missed.
Sorry Herb, but I think you missed the boat with this series.
This is a sub-par album for any band, let alone one as stellar as King's X. As many have already mentioned, it's a modern recording of a bunch of rehashed throw-away tunes that didn't make it onto their first album, Out of the Silent Planet. They were put in the circular file then, and that's honestly where they should have stayed.
The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
It's cheesy, 1980s pop-rock that is barely saved by the fact that it being played by a band with incredible execution.
Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.
Honestly, this album should be avoided by anyone except collectors.
It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black, with alot of old tired riffs.
The producers never even feature 1 song where his playing takes control.
I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when, and I must say I knew he would be a star, but this album is sooo lack-luster, very disappointing.
Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
It's almost like she's saying, "I'm Beyonce, I'm amazing, and people will jump on anything I create, so why even make an attempt."
I'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album, and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such, all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album.
There was nothing deluxe about it.
After listening to the first disc, I almost felt I had to check my stereo to make sure I didn't have the same song on repeat over and over.
The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power.
There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.
It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.
Beyonce, you're incredible, but this album was a slap in the face to all of your fans and anyone who even mildly liked you.
Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
It definately seems like I'm bashing Beyonce in this review, but I'm not bashing her, I'm bashing her feeble effort in this album release.
Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it's definately this one.
This is NOT the great version I heard!!!
I'd stay away from Captiol CD's or compilation CD's which include Capitol re-recordings of the Andrews like this one.
Anyone can easily tell these are not the original hits.
There is no way that "Puppy Love" or "Diana" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed.
Gilmour's attempts at emulating Roger's unique lyricism have fallen somewhat short.
However, it makes one yearn hard for the classic days of PF's heyday.
To my surprise 'Who Keeps Changing Your Mind?'
was FADED OUT after only 4 mins!!!
Lead singer Nike Nile's voice just doesn't do it for me.
Perhaps I set the bar too high, because I was sorely disappointed.
Also, how many times is Dieselboy going to have mixes of "Follow the Leader" and "You Must Follow" on his albums.
Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included "Submission" and "Barrier Breaks" from the 12" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new, hot tracks on your album??
Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.
For example, compare Eric's lame take of "When You've Got A Good Friend," with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition.
And the remake of "Hellhound on My Trail," Johnson's signature tune??
What a disappointment!!
Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!!
To me it was just not original.
But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines, multi-layering, and auto-tuning.
The delicate, vine-laden garden lattice of "Unfold" has been replaced by a hard, brick wall of sound this time out.
But it doesn't do much for me.
"Disappointing" I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.
I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
This game also doesn't have a lot of building items, after I made a couple places my houses started to look the same.
My friend had said before I bought it to don't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and didn't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it.
I was highly disapointed with this game.
What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.
You always had the same weapons, techniques, and the minions would always act the same!
They all just staggered back when they died and always seemed to come out of nowhere!
Then the bosses weren't even historically accurate, and it didn't take a historian to figure that out!
The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.
"All flash, no substance" Features -All skill-requiring mini-games have been removed!
Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
Yay! -Use of the microphone!
Because everybody loves microphone games!
But it's cool if you don't have one because then you have a space on every board that does nothing!
Awesome eh?
-Amazingly pointless, annoying new game mechanics!
Let's just say I'm glad I rented.
That's the only real apeal to this game though, I don't think any more poorly of the Mario Party series for this game....it's just not worth buying...
Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.
The second installment in the Final Fantasy Legends series, is probably the worst, and later on, becomes physically painful to play.
Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.
Normally I don't have problems with simple stories, but when combined with the monotony of the quest, you'd think they would have written a better story, to keep you interested.
Gameplay : 1/10 As you journey around, you have to battle against other monsters, and buy weapons/armour, like any other game.
The only problem with FFL2 is the fact that you never gain a ''level'' you just randomly gain stats, which gets annoying, since you have to spend so much more time ''level'' building, than any other RPG I've played.
And when you get to the later levels, and the monsters are extremely tough, this becomes even more annoying, with the limited weapons use.
You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.
Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....
it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
Sound : 1/10 A problem that seems to infest all the other GB FFL games, is the overly ''sad'' music.
Normally, I don't complain about music, but in most games, the tunes are at least halfway decent, and you can continue playing without having to have the game on mute.
But with FFL2, the music just is so repetitive, and melancholy, even during the ''happy'' parts of this game.
Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.
Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS!
DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME!
Pick up FFA or FFL3 for halfway decent Final Fantasy games on the GB. Final Comments: I was stuck with this game and Mario Golf being my only entertainment on a cross country trip (I lost 4-5 of my GBC/GB games in a hotel room) and every time I tried to stomach through this game, I kept running back to Mario Golf. Please, if you want a good game, get anything but this.
look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty.
i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.
not really any replay value and theres only 1 special unlock at the end of the game, after u get that its boring.
so again, i wouldnt advise any of u to buy it.
This is the worst port I've played in a long time.
And I thought Mass Effect was bad.
By comparison this game makes the transfer of Mass Effect from Xbox to PC look like a carefully designed masterpiece.
The controls are lousy.
You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping.
Miserable to play throughout.
The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s).
I can't get decent frames no matter what.
I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics.
Other problems include common clipping issues, buildings and terrain that pops up out of nowhere, and the worst skins I've seen on character models since 2004. The models are sloppy, robotic looking, and frankly ugly.
Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish.
The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.
Don't waste your money and try to play this game on the PC. It will frustrate you, anger you, and make you want to chuck the game in the trash.
It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.
Don't buy under any circumstances.
Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
It's just a fatter and faster version of the standard-zombie from HL2. How refreshing.
Did they become smarter?
No...not at all.
They just come rushing towards you.
It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
Do you pay for an superb new concept with fantastic eyecandy, great gameplay and AI?
No....you pay $20,- for 3 hours 'more of the same'.
Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
until he finished it after 3 days.
He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
He couldn't understand why there were no more levels to play.
I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
"I already played this story.
I want more Diego!"
My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
Especially not any over 3 years old.
It was a total waste of my money.
If I could return it and get a refund I would.
And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.
Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!
... Cons: Everything....
simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
If ya want emmersion, and overall the highest levels of reality you can get, buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.
Do youself a favor, get your head's out from where ever you all have stuck them and get with the program, either FreeFalcon or Openfalcon for true realisim and performance.
I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt, u cant save at all...
even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
The distance between save pts is a few town away...
wat the hell !!! So it was a waste of time...
If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...
U cant imagine us playing for few hours and don't die at all...
and if die is game over...
Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...
Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...
... Cons: No original illustrations to find.
No ability to change from English to Japanese in the music/subtitles.
Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.
Gaming grid system is gone.
Took away game play settings.
I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS, and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.
Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.
Also with the illustration issue, the icons that represent the characters expressions when they're talking, were JUST FINE the way they were and I do not see how REDRAWING all of them enhanced the experience.
What time they spent redrawing those expressions they could have used to maintain the original grid system format for the DS. A different issue is the gameplay settings: Easy(aka never played a video game in your life), Medium (aka played one rpg), and Hard (aka easy mode on normal rpgs) have disappeared.
Admittedly, I'm sure we didn't NEED the settings, but if anything, making Rhapsody HARDER or adding an experience booster would've better than eliminating the settings all together.
Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.
I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.
We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.
The next time a company remakes a game for fans, THEY SHOULD ASK FIRST. BRING IT UP ON MORE FORUMS, WE WILL BE INTERESTED.
Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.
The game play is annoying, repetitive, and stupidly hard.
I have a lot of problems with this game.
First of all, you do the exact same things through the whole game.
The game never changes up, it is the same all the way through.
One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
I will now tell you all you need to know to survive any fight you get into, hold RT, hit X as soon as your foe attacks, and you counter, that's all you need to do.
If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.
You have now mastered the fighting game.
Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
Then guess what, time to replay the whole segment, but you have to listen and watch the same video and mission start again because there is no skip option.
Brilliant, loving this.
Let's throw in the fact you have time limits on these assassination missions also, and you get a completely annoying game that is cheap and will aggravate you past the point of reason.
Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
Well, time to try again.
This is not fun.
And I agree the game should not be easy, but it is almost impossible, which really ruins a game based on stealth.
Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.
Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.
You can't aim at anything!
The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.
The other flaw is the level design.
Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!
When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable.
Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.
RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful.
If you haven't played RE1 you're not missing much at all.
The only problem I have with anything graphical are some of the transitions between animations in the game...
they just don't seem to blend as well as I had hoped.
I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.
I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???
The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.
Maybe next year or the version for the PS3 will be what Live gamers were expecting from a next generation title.
Finally, I have to give this game such a low value rating because all you are getting for a $60 game is a single game mode, basic season mode, online play, and create a player...
I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.
It's like NBA Live without serveral of the features that make Live such a fun bball series.
The only thing is though, is that if you've played Xbox games with great graphics, Halo, for instance, then you will be disgusted by this games' graphics.
Another thing-Crash does not play as well as he used to.
Crash used to run- now he seems to run, but very slowly.
He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
Also, his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.
The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
"Disappointing" The overall storyline of the game is held together by poor one-liners.
The storyline is flat and uninventive.
utterly disappointing.
The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.
You basically have spells and weapons, then hack and slash your way through the enemies to the bosses.
Finish the boss, move on to the next mission.
Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.
Even the special effects are lacking.
Don't buy it, its a waste of money.
They're all basically the same.
"Almost, but not quite" The game has a feel to it like CoV (the quest/mission instance's)but with out the quickness and fun.
What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
Even if it means being up till 6:00 when u halfta work the next morning at 8:00 or 9:00:( The game also takes a real long time to lvl in compareason with other morgs with a really low cap (I could get a char to lvl 15-20 or so in WOW in the time it would take me to get to lvl 2-4 in DDO. But I imagine i could get a couple of chars to lvl 10 in DDO in the time it would get a char in WOW to lvl 60) So it takes a while to get going in DDO where other MMORGS let u get some early lvls fairly easy to get u hooked(interested) Where as DDO u are a wimp for a long time whitch isnt fun.
I think DDO will go the way of all turbine's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit.
"All flash, no substance" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.
I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
The 40 bucks I spent for this game is sorley missed, refund is desired k thanks.
Though...After spending some time in a level with pretty much the same exact music, it gets boring...and annoying...and after the whole game, the same tracks are used in atleast four different levels...I think....Maybe it's the same track in every level...
I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.
Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
Generally the rewards for playing good are superior to taking an evil option (and sometimes there isn't a clear-cut evil option available at all).
-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
The Bad-Low end PCs can't run next-gen graphics; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell?!-Early in the game, you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette.
Also, your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off, so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy.
Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
If you graduate to intelligent enemies, the game is "very challenging," aka "painful."
You may win one out of ten tries.
That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.
The story is really the same as KH, but they replace "heart" with memory.
Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.
Very little music or anything to speak of.
The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.
Wasted two hours.
A bit predictable.
It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.
This short film certainly pulls no punches.
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.
Today the graphics are crap.
This was a flick doomed from its conception.
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.
I wasn't the least bit interested.
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.
But it's just not funny.
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.
On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.
Long, whiny and pointless.
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.
I was very disappointed in the movie.
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.
This movie totally grates on my nerves.
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.
I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of Québec.
The problem was the script.
It was horrendous.
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.
Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.
The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.
It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.
Too politically correct.
Very disappointing.
I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.
The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!
), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.
The directing seems too pretentious.
The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.
However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".
All in all, a great disappointment.
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.
I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.
Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.
It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.
You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.
This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.
A truly, truly bad film.
The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.
I paid too much.
It was so BORING!
No plot whatsoever!
Again, no plot at all.
Horrible!
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!
I hate movies like that.
Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!
If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.
Awful.
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.
It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.
NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).
This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.
Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.
I mean this in a terrible way.
This film has no redeeming features.
Everything is appalling.
Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.
The story is beyond stupid.
The script iswas there a script?
The kids are annoying.
The lead man is charisma-free.
Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.
I'll even say it again  this is torture.
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.
Highly unrecommended.
If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.
Yes, it's that bad.
Nothing at all to recommend.
This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.
There were too many close ups.
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.
This movie is BAD.
So bad.
The film is way too long.
This is definitely one of the bad ones.
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.
Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.
The character developments also lacked in depth.
Woa, talk about awful.
Do not waste your time.
It was just too horrible.
The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.
The poor actors.
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.
Regrettably, the film fails.
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.
Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!
The dialogue sucked.
The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.
The soundtrack sucked.
The acting sucked.
The concert sequences just sucked.
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.
I came out of it feeling angry.
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.
It was forced, like everything in this movie.
Again, lame.
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.
Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.
The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.
The acting was bad.
Really bad.
Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.
Camerawork - again, bad.
Rating: 1 out of 10.
I literally vomited while watching this film.
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".
To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .
One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.
This movie is terrible.
The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.
For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.
Glad I didn't pay to see it.
Didn't laugh or even smile once.
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...
" But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.
It's just lame.
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.
Everything about this movie is stupid.
Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.
It is shameful.
The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.
I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.
It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.
The jerky camera movements were also annoying.
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.
There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.
I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.
If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.
All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.
God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.
Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.
I couldn't take them seriously.
I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.
Even worse than Ticker!
& That movie was bad.
Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!
It just blew.
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.
This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.
Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.
I wish I could enter negative values, admins?
The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.
The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.
Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.
I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.
But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.
Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.
But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.
I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.
Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.
The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.
Wow, what a bad film.
Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.
The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.
Not even good for camp value!
I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?
You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.
This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!
This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.
This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.
Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.
But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.
The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.
Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.
A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.
Even the squibs look awful.
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.
The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.
I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.
The directing is sloppy at best.
Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.
Of course, the acting is blah.
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.
And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.
I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.
About half way through this film I started to dislike it.
By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.
What this film lacks is a convincing script.
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.
Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.
Everything about it is just bad.
I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.
The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.
The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.
Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!
It is zillion times away from reality.
Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.
Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.
20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.
And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!
(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.
first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.
putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.
there is no real plot.
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.
The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.
I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.
This may be the only bad film he ever made.
So bad...well...it's just bad.
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.
It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.
I thought it was bad.
Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.
Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.
The script is a big flawed mess.
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.
Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.
The movie is terribly boring in places.
The lighting is awful.
The film looks cheap and bland.
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.
This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.
The visual effects were AWFUL.
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!
The "explosion" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.
To sum the film up, "Breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.
Not recommended.
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.
Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.
I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.
Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.
The budget was evidently very limited.
This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.
However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.
Filmiing was less expansive.
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.
Generally; it just lacked imagination.
Not recommended.
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.
Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.
Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!
I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!
Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.
Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?
To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.
In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.
The story line is just awful!
It's just painful!
And the accents are absolutely abysmal!
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.
Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.
Omit watching this.
My rating: just 3 out of 10.
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.
Regardless, the film fails on most levels.
Avoid at all costs.
I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.
He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.
This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.
The least said about the acting the better.
Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.
Unless you're just out to visually "collect" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.
It is not good.
Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.
Then the film just dropped the ball.
There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.
I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.
It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.
Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.
It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.
It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.
) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.
It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.
How awful she is!
But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.
The results, well, are a shame.
DELETE this film from your mind!
One of the worst shows of all time.
The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.
The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???
Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.
Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, "you see kids..." Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.
Lame would be the best way to describe it.
Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.
The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.
You can find better movies at youtube.
Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.
A Lassie movie which should have been "put to sleep".... FOREVER.
That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.
So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.
It isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie.
It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.
Seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.
Avoid, avoid, avoid!
It will drive you barking mad!
Nothing new there.
That was done in the second movie.
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?
The football scenes at the end were perplexing.
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.
And it was boring.
I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.
Why was this film made?
The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.
The result is a film that just don't look right.
None of them are engaging or exciting.
The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.
The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.
How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.
In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.
Avoid at ALL costs!
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.
The worst one of the series.
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.
It's very slow.
Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.
) Don't waste your time.
End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.
He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.
I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?
Lots of holes in the script.
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.
The dialogue is atrocious.
The acting is beyond abysmal.
Everything stinks.
Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.
Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.
It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.
In short, don't bother with this movie.
Also the story and acting were weak.
At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.
Either way, it sucks.
The script is horrendously stupid.
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.
What the hell kind of crap is that?!
Then, there's the plot holes.
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!
Dee Snider just plain sucks.
He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.
The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.
Avoid at any and all costs.
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.
Avoid this film at all costs.
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.
Now this is a movie I really dislike.
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.
Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.
This one just fails to create any real suspense.
As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.
One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.
Hated it.
This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.
I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.
This is not movie-making.
The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.
So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!
I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.
Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.
The story line is totally predictable.
I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.
Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.
Really awful.
Not easy to watch.
Just whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.
The movie seemed a little slow at first.
If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!
This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.
Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.
I never walked out of a movie faster.
I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!
Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.
In a word, it is embarrassing.
Exceptionally bad!
All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.
Crust is not good.
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.
Would not go back.
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.
Waitress was a little slow in service.
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.
did not like at all.
The Burrittos Blah!
- They never brought a salad we asked for.
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.
The worst was the salmon sashimi.
This was like the final blow!
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.
Service sucks.
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.
The service was meh.
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.
Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.
Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.
Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.
Low Quality.
Warning - Stay away.
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.
I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.
If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.
Very Displeased.
I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.
Does not fit.
There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.
I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.
I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.
Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.
Horrible phone.
BT50 battery junk!.
Cant get the software to work with my computer.
Disappointed!.
poor voice clarity.
No buyers remorse on this one!.
Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.
The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.
Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.
Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).
The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.
I'd like to return it.
Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.
A Disappointment.
Its not user friendly.
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.
Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.
Pretty piece of junk.
Plug was the wrong size.
Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.
Bad Purchase.
Defective crap.
I would have given no star if I was able.
The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.
I would not recommend this item to anyone.
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.
As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)
REALLY UGLY.
horrible, had to switch 3 times.
No real improvement.
They refuse to refund or replace.
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.
Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.
Don't buy this product.
sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.
I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.
It's AGGRAVATING!
None of it works, just don't buy it.
Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.
Please dont waste your money.
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.
Disapointing Results.
Cumbersome design.
It's A PIECE OF CRAP!
My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!
Worst ever.
I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying "what?"
The battery life is highly unacceptable.
That company is a joke.
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.
Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.
Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.
It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.
I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.
Sprint - terrible customer service.
What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...
Piece of trash.
The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.
Poor Construction.
This is infuriating.
Sprint charges for this service.
It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.
Poor product.
However I needed some better instructions.
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS
Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.
Very Dissapointing Performance.
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.
Don't bother - go to the store.
You get what you pay for I guess.
However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.
Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.
Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.
I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!
When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.
Battery is terrible.
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.
Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.
Talk about USELESS customer service.
It felt too light and "tinny.".
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.
I could not recommend these more.
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.
A must study for anyone interested in the "worst sins" of industrial design.
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.
Can't upload ringtones from a third party.
Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.
Truly awful.
And none of the tones is acceptable.
camera color balance is AWFUL.
This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.
The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.
It doesn't make you look cool.
Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.
So just beware.
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.
It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.
Poor quality.
Not worth it.
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.
Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros
Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!
It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.
Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!
stay away from this store, be careful.
Does not fit.
disappointing.
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.
Would not reccommend.
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.
wont work right or atleast for me.
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.
But now that it is "out of warranty" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.
I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.
VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.
I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.
After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.
I am sorry I made this purchase.
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.
It was horrible!.
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.
They work about 2 weeks then break.
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.
NOT WHAT I WANTED.
The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.
$50 Down the drain.
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.
If there is a wind, it is completely useless.
Does Not Work.
At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).
Improper description.... I had to return it.
Battery has no life.
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.
Doesn't do the job.
Awkward to use and unreliable.
Not as good as I had hoped.
Doesn't Work.
Unfortunately it did not work.
All three broke within two months of use.
dont buy it.
My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.
However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.
The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.
Horrible, horrible protector.
I don't like this Nokia either.
Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.
Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.
It's not what it says it is.
Stay Away From the Q!.
Used and dirty.
Very unreliable service from T-mobile !
Not good enough for the price.
I bought two of them and neither will charge.
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.
Just does not work.
Poor Reliability.
If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.
Terrible product, and waste of money!
Last time buying from you.
It was a waste of my money.
The item received was Counterfeit.
This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.
The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.
Having trouble with volume.
WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.
When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.
I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.
Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.
Bad Reception.
This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!
Don't buy this product - It fails!.
Everything about this product is wrong.First
This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.
Terrible phone holder.
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.
How stupid is that?
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.
Couldn't figure it out
My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.
While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.
Saggy, floppy piece of junk.
It also had a new problem.
It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.
As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!
Never got it!!!!!
This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!
Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.
However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.
I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.
The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.
I'm returning them.
I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.
I had to purchase a different case.
Very much disappointed with this company.
It didn't charge for me.
Buttons are too small.
However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.
I cannot make calls at certain places.
however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.
I'm trying to return it for a refund.
I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.
Earbud piece breaks easily.
Lousy product.
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.
Not enough volume.
Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.
don't waste your money.
I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.
Adapter does not provide enough charging current.
There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.
You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.
Phone falls out easily.
It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk.
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.
Painful on the ear.
Lasted one day and then blew up.
disappointed.
Kind of flops around.
The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.
What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.
Item Does Not Match Picture.
The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).
You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.
The turkey and roast beef were bland.
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!
say bye bye to your tip lady!
We'll never go again.
It was not good.
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.
It was pretty gross!
I've had better atmosphere.
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...
I wouldn't return.
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.
The management is rude.
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.
Don't do it!!!!
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.
I give it 2 thumbs down
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.
Avoid at all cost!
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...
I've never been treated so bad.
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
It was probably dirt.
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.
The live music on Fridays totally blows.
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
The warm beer didn't help.
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
Must have been an off night at this place.
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.
For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.
Won't go back.
Soggy and not good.
Which are small and not worth the price.
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!
The service was a bit lacking.
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.
As for the "mains," also uninspired.
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.
The descriptions said "yum yum sauce" and another said "eel sauce", yet another said "spicy mayo"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.
(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.
like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.
very tough and very short on flavor!
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.
The service was not up to par, either.
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.
I think not again
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.
Service stinks here!
I waited and waited.
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!
Just don't know why they were so slow.
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.
Never again will I be dining at this place!
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.
Food was really boring.
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!
Will never, ever go back.
As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.
Never going back.
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.
The only downside is the service.
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.
Everything was gross.
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!
The burger... I got the "Gold Standard" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.
There is nothing authentic about this place.
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.
He was terrible!
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.
Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.
I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.
They dropped more than the ball.
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.
I took back my money and got outta there.
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.
I won't be back.
The food was terrible.
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
This is a disgrace.
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.
This one is simply a disappointment.
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!
Left very frustrated.
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.
For service, I give them no stars.
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).
But now I was completely grossed out.
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.
Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.
What a mistake that was!
Waiter was a jerk.
Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.
I never come again.
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.
Nothing special.
Will not be back.
Sauce was tasteless.
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
I was so insulted.
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.
The manager was the worst.
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.
Don't waste your time here.
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.
Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.
The selection of food was not the best.
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.
Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.
And then tragedy struck.
I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.
I would not recommend this place.
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.
My gyro was basically lettuce only.
Terrible service!
Thoroughly disappointed!
it was a drive to get there.
Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.
A greasy, unhealthy meal.
first time there and might just be the last.
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.
And it was way to expensive.
Terrible management.
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.
Worst martini ever!
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.
No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.
not even a "hello, we will be right with you."
The desserts were a bit strange.
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.
After two I felt disgusting.
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!
The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an "Are you being helped?"
AN HOUR... seriously?
I consider this theft.
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.
Waited and waited and waited.
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.
Boy was that sucker dry!!.
Over rated.
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.
The kids play area is NASTY!
It was extremely "crumby" and pretty tasteless.
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!
Not good for the money.
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.
I just wanted to leave.
I will not be eating there again.
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.
The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.
Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.
Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.
I will not return.
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.
Very disappointing!!!
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.
I'm not eating here!
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.
Very bad Experience!
What a mistake.
Food was average at best.
We won't be going back anytime soon!
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.
The fried rice was dry as well.
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.
dont go here.
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.
Service was slow and not attentive.
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.
Total brunch fail.
I probably won't be back, to be honest.
Went for lunch - service was slow.
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.
I was mortified.
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.
Would not recommend to others.
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!
Not my thing.
If you are reading this please don't go there.
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.
It was way over fried.
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.
Will not be back!
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.
The service was poor and thats being nice.
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.
But the service was beyond bad.
Tasted like dirt.
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.
the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional Hunan style".
What did bother me, was the slow service.
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
Unfortunately, it was not good.
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.
We will not be coming back.
Once your food arrives it's meh.
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.
Mediocre food.
I'm super pissd.
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
The service was terrible though.
This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!
It was packed!!
The food was terrible.
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.
This place should honestly be blown up.
But I definitely would not eat here again.
Do not waste your money here!
Awful service.
Won't ever go here again.
Food quality has been horrible.
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.
The service here is fair at best.
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.
Very poor service.
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.
I won't be back.
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!
This place deserves no stars.
I would not recommend this place.
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!
I probably would not go here again.
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.
I probably won't be coming back here.
Worst food/service I've had in a while.
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.
Weird vibe from owners.
There was hardly any meat.
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.
Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.
The service was extremely slow.
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.
Worst Thai ever.
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!
Spend your money elsewhere.
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
And the drinks are WEAK, people!
-My order was not correct.
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
We won't be returning.
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
Very, very sad.
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.
This place is disgusting!
The RI style calamari was a joke.
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
Disappointing experience.
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.
We won't be going back.
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.
This place lacked style!!
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.
Don't bother coming here.
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.
The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.
It was equally awful.
Probably not in a hurry to go back.
very slow at seating even with reservation.
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.
I was VERY disappointed!!
This place is horrible and way overpriced.
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.
Con: spotty service.
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.
But then they came back cold.
Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.
The real disappointment was our waiter.
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
But I don't like it.
Hell no will I go back
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back "ya'all".
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.
The ambiance isn't much better.
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.
The food wasn't good.
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.
What happened next was pretty....off putting.
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.
Overpriced for what you are getting.
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
Food was below average.
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
Spend your money and time some place else.
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
the presentation of the food was awful.
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
Appetite instantly gone.
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.
I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.
The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.
I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything.
However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.
The plug did not work very well.
AMAZON SUCKS.
Rip off---- Over charge shipping.
1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.
Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.
Very disappointing.
It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.
Was not happy.
A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!
Worst customer service.
Reception is terrible and full of static.
I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal.
Were JERKS on the phone.
Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.
Excellent starter wireless headset.
The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.
The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.
First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!
Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.
bad fit, way too big.
Waste of money.
I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.
The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.
Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.
This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.
This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.
Soyo technology sucks.
Same problem as others have mentioned.
The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.
Poor sound quality.
The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.
Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear.
Still Waiting...... I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it!
what a disappointment
don't waste your money and time.
It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.
I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.
I'll be looking for a new earpiece.
We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement
After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.
This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.
Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.
The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.
Don't make the same mistake I did.
The book is disproportionally focused on single and multilayer feedforward networks.
And though the book puts great emphasis on mathematics and even includes a big section on important mathematical background knowledge, it contains to many errors in the mathematical formulas, so they are of little use.
The author hasn't even taken the trouble to put up an errata list.
Finally, for the beginner there are not enough conceptual clues on what is actually going on and it is hard to form any mental model of the underlying processes.
There are better books.
I began this novel with the greatest of hopes, and finished it in an effort to fully understand what a really bad novel consists of.
It held the promise of leading off into a sci-fi novel but didn't quite reach anything beyond the mundane until the last couple of chapters of the book.
Reading the introductions to numerous sub-characters that had no relation to the plot (if there was one)was painfully boring and took up a good part of the book.
The relationship between Michael (the main character) and Angela (a complete stranger he hops into bed with in the first chapter) is not only unplausable and mesogenistic it reads like the fantastic pipe-dream of a teenage boy.
When the the main character finally reaches something vaguely interesting, the discovery of an alien corridor, he takes a break from uncovering it to go have a day at the art museum and shopping with his girlfriend.
Note to author: Reading doesn't have to be as painful as a dentist appointment.
It wasn't worth the wait.
Somewhere between 2005 and now, Koontz decided not to take the whole thing too seriously: What began as a pulpish horror/adventure story with humorous overtones has morphed into a full-blown farce, complete with a naked, dancing troll with a taste for bath soap and interminable scenes filled with wacky patter that would be more at home in a romantic comedy.
Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Madison are reduced to supporting roles, nattering on about raising babies (they're now in love), eating and shooting guns.
A Three Stooges moment as they pursue a naked husband and wife -- one of whom has a "perky butt" -- who are in turn pursuing a dog gives them their sole opportunity to use the guns they have been ogling since book two.
The long build-up given to their anticipated shoot out with Victor Frankenstein is a dead end.
But it's too little, too late.
After 352 relentlessly padded pages (I gave up counting how many times Koontz tells us that Victor's creatures gain their memories through data-downloads), the Frankenstein series that began with so much promise limps across the finish line, a pale shadow of what it could have been.
After reading Blow fly I doubt that I will ever buy another.
Its a shame to be forced to give this novel a one star rating.
I think Patricia is simply milking the system on her way to retirement.
What a letdown.
Are her publishers totally ignoring the ever increasing deploring reviews?
I truly believe that the end is near for Patricia.
Please don't buy this novel because soon all the used book stores will have dozens of copies with hardly a page turned.
Patricia, please retire with some dignity!
However, today, 60 years after it was first published , "How to read a Book" doesn't impress as much.
This is not the book for your goal.
He takes examples of Homer and Hamlet but all that Mortimer does is to add lots and lots of padding and useless words to drive his point across.
However, once I realized that there is little meaningful text hidden between tons of useless babble, I started speed reading and found that it was enough to read just the title of each paragraph and a line or 2 in caps.
I raced through rest of the 300 pages in another hour and I haven't missed anything!
But if you are looking for speed reading book, this is not the one.
But the in-depth commentary on the Psalms, the saints, the Church, on liturgy and theology..and especially the people of the monastic world..
which was so very prominent in her "Walk" is missing.
However, in my opinion a book's value is not in merely restating what has already been written, but in the creative contributions to and interpretations of what already is.
This does not happen.
Shame on the publishers!
First of all, this book put me to sleep several times.
Barbara Hambly is no doubt a good writer, but I think she would be better served writing romance novels.
Babara Hambly spends much time giving overly eloquent/poetic descriptions of the surroundings, moods, and thoughts of characters but hey, Star Wars was not meant to be Shakespere.
It's obvious that she gave very little thought to who the target audience is.
Well first of all she came up with the very original idea of an Imperial Super Weapon. Second, you know how many authors describe the difficulty of creating adversaries to give a worthwhile challenge for a very powerful hero?
Around the fourth time I saw this pattern I got disgusted.
What's the matter Barbara?
Couldn't think of a challenging bad guy?
This was a very cheap substitute.
And what of the good old Jedi healing or pain blocking techniques?
Oh but this hurt Luke too bad for Jedi techniques to work.
Riiight.
;-) Final analysis: This is beyond a doubt the most boring book I have EVER READ!
I would hate to see such a sad effort get enough unintentional support that they allow, let alone recruit BH to write a third book.
Yuck!
I thought at first maybe I had a defective version of the book but after reading other reviews, I see that our problem is normal.
We had to replace the batteries after a weekend of play with the newly purchased book.
The second set of batteries only lasted a week.
However, I found it very hard to enjoy the book because I really disliked the main character Amir. He was to cowardly, so childish throughout his whole life, whining and complaining through much of the 371 pages it took to tell the story.
I never felt bad once for Amir, but I loathed him even to the end.
And that's why I could not enjoy this novel more.
I couldn't connect with the character the author wanted his readers to connect with.
Perhaps that's where the crux of the problem actually is.
By having too simple a writing style, the author took some of the weight off a story that needed something heavier.
However, I do not recommend this, because the softy in me found myself tearing up on a few occasions and trying to fight back the tears as other people trying to get to work pretended not to notice.
The Dark Storm is the first book in a new urban-fantasy series from author Kris Greene and while it does have some decent writing, it is amazingly generic.
It's almost like what if you took a bunch of stuff from other books- a world of demons, agents of light, vampires, goblins, knights, werewolves and mystical weapons of power, blended them all together and weaved the story around the template on "how-to" write an urban-fantasy novel.
If this was any more by-the-numbers I would have sworn I'd read it already.
The main problem I had with this book is it's characterization, or lack there of.
There's just way to many characters crammed into this slim work (the story constantly shifts through multiple POV's), that I felt like I was missing half the novel, like it was incomplete.
There's a sequel to The Dark Storm as there generally is with this sub-genre, but that's no excuse to have such a flimsy table setter.
Also, the two "main" characters of the book, Gabriel Redfeather and De Mona Sanchez (and yes that's her real name!!)
are so poorly formed as characters that they feel like they're cursory characters in the background, rather then the one's the whole series is based around.
And they both whined and whined so much, especially Gabriel, that I had to re-read the earlier pages and remind myself that he wasn't a freshman in highschool, but already in college!!!
But man, the most important aspect of the story, the very foundation the world is based around, the magical weapons, felt the weakest in the entire story.
Their characteristics and attributes are never fully thought out and explained, their powers appearing more as poor imagination rather than weapons that can control the very fabric of the world.
It's all just so generic that in 2 weeks I probably won't remember the story anymore and sadly I won't be coming back for the upcoming sequel Demon Hunt.
Things I wasn't a fan of--the ending was to cutesy for my taste.
Also, all of the side characters (particularly the mom, Vee, and the teacher) were incredibly flat and stereotypical to me.
Whereas in “The Alchemist” I felt I was being lectured by a monotonous professor about how to achieve my “Personal Legend”, by nailing the point into my head over and over.
Actually the phrase “Personal Legend” was used 55 times in this book of 208 pages.
About once every four pages.
But personally I much prefer the writing of LM Montgomery over Paulo Coelho. I didn't come to love the characters in “The Alchemist” as I did the characters from Avonlea.
Yes there is a war against evil going on, but decapitations?
Blood spurting?
Brain matter on spears?
I wish Paolini spent more time on developing his characters as he did with the endless battle (read blood and guts) scenes.
I puzzled over the middle while he was lost at sea with the tiger.
I didn't get the island at all.
The last two CD's don't contain any useful information and are somewhat out of scope.
This is a very one dimensional book.
The story didn't seem to be very original.
We have all read books, watched plays or movies of handicapped children who undertake huge tasks and complete them.
The book also fails to explore the relationship between Christopher and his mother even though his bond with his father has been explained well enough.
Readers get no insight into rest of the characters who could have very well defined the nature of relationship between Christopher and his parents.
Very one dimensional.
Set amidst US presidential race, terrorist attacks in the middle east and 3 insignificant judges in a federal prison, the book spins a tale of political showdowns and prison scams that get intertwined in the most improbable but highly predictable way.
The end just happens, as if the author is in a hurry to make it happen or lacks better imagination.
Though Ishmael does present some good examples, I didn't find the text powerfull enough to convince me.
Some explanations seem to be too simplistic.
I feel like a different voice should have been used though.
The mans voice on the cd isn't very soothing.
There are parts where it's quiet for a few minutes and then when he starts talking again, it's more startling due to the tone of his voice.
Maybe a woman's voice would have been better.
However, these mentions are often brief and may leave one wanting to hear more and explore the level of monotheism that was really practiced.
The only drawback is the use of the example microworld.
I believe that most readers would have rather read about Vincentes experience in nuclear power plants with all its technical complexity than being bored by his fabricated and dull pump system.
The exercises are very basic.
I recommend reading the Gospel in Syriac for further excercise.
EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) Strained 'sequel' to "BRUCE ALMIGHTY" with Carell's jerk anchorman Evan Baxter leaving TV to begin his stint as a freshman Congressional rep has his hands full when God (Freeman reprising his holy role; Jim Carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like Noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have).
The Godforsaken sitcom-y script by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow is absolutely lame and only Carell's amiable persona transcends his vain Evan into something resembling a human being.
The end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat (reportedly costing $175 M for the CGI F/X).
Sacrilegiously unfunny.
BOOGEYMAN (2005) 0* Barry Watson, Emily Deschanel, Skye McCole Bartusiak, Lucy Lawless, Tory Mussett, Robyn Malcolm, Charles Mesure. Vapid, convoluted non-sensical mess of alleged 'horror' film about a young man (vanilla Watson) making a reluctant homecoming to face his fears in the form of the urban legend of the closet monster that may (or may not; frankly who cares??!!!)
Not one sequence to the next has a cohesive thought or relation to the other is just the beginning of this inept genre flick with some laughable 'creature' f/x to say the least.
Just plain sucks.
Producer Sam Raimi should be ashamed of himself for torturing us with this crap.
UNDEAD (2005) 0 * Arguably one of the worst films I've ever seen – nonsensical hodgepodge about a meteorite shower causing an Australian fishing village to become zombies with it's so-sure-of-itself-smugness incorporating (ok --- Stealing!
Robert Rodriguez camera angles, "Matrix" type pacings and Peter Jackson's seminal "DeadAlive" to name three counts of plagiarism) far too many hybrids and quite frankly a real mess overall.
I realize low-budget independent movies should be given some slack but the bargain basement bloodiness (while plentiful) is the least of this film's problems.
There is no rhyme or reason to the film as it progresses and by the end it doesn't explain anything that has just transpired (or even attempts too!)
I'm not even going to include the lame cast and simply say the directors : Michael & Peter Spierig should just give it all up and stop while they're behind.
Atrocious!
SLOW BURN (2007) * Ray Liotta, LL Cool J, Mekhi Phifer, Jolene Blalock, Guy Torry, Taye Diggs, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Bruce McGill. More like a simmering potboiler: 1995's crackling neo-noir sleeper "The Usual Suspects" was in a class by itself but lately there have been some numerous copycats in attempting to glean some magic from its infamous twisted ending revealing who its arch-criminal Keyser Soze really was.
The latest pretender to the throne is a horse of another color (and yes the pun is meant to be offensive).
Adding fuel to the fire is many turns in this serpentine crime drama that offers about as much suspense as a re-run of any form of "Law & Order": Timmer may or may not have been having an affair with the deceased assailant, may or may not know the true identity of the mysterious local kingpin and may or may not be involved in a convoluted scheme involving high-level real estate conspiracies with the aforementioned gangsta.
The whole lousy mess is indecipherable until it's cribbing of the final act of "Suspects" for its own conclusion that not only cheats a smart, knowing audience but feels like a cheat from the minute one character is onto another with a fateful 'wait=a-second' glance and pause in his tracks.
Although Blalock is a real hottie, the shameful way her character is depicted as either a 'sista pretending to be white' or vice versea as some sort of living-in-the-shadows- chameleon is only further drummed over the head by the ham-fisted direction by Wayne Beach in his debut as a helmsman and also the film's scribe.
The fact he actually shows a real-life chameleon during several sequences involving Nora is truly eye rolling.
It doesn't help that the film has been on the shelf for several year.
That's never a good sign and another is shamefully stealing from a real classic.
Tongue-thru-cheek T&A and dumb-as-a- stump zombie homage mashup of sub-Cormanian sleaze that frankly hasn't a clever thought in its ripped out skull: a futuristic US government run amok has an experiment gone awry resulting in a horde of zombies with ap*ss and vinegar Marine troop set in for the kill, only to unknowingly transmit the virus at a nearby strip-joint resulting in the titular monster- mish-mash.
The gore effects are a mixed lot with buckets of viscera for the masses and a hammy – cry for help from Englund as the germ-phobic flamboyant joint owner (!) and porn- star supreme Jameson as the first of the afflicted strippers (!!) You've been warned – although I did like Bach's 'assets' as the busty gung-ho jarhead (and sadly the only one who isn't nude!
So a demerit there!)
Written and directed by Jay Lee, heir apparent to Ed Wood for the 21st Century anyone?
ROCKET SCIENCE (2007) * Reece Thompson, Anna Kendrick, Nicholas D'Agostino, Vincent Piazza, Margo Martidale, Aaron Yoo, Josh Kay, Steve Park, Lisbeth Bartlett, Denis O'Hare, Jonah Hill. (Dir: Jeffrey Blitz) Lame mix of "ELECTION" and "RUSHMORE" Why is it some of the indies heralded at such prestigious film fests like Sundance often come across as crass, self-involved, hateful pieces of turgid junk?
I realize they can't all be gems but the latest offering had me grinding my teeth in deep hatred.
While documentary filmmaker Blitz is said to have based this alleged comedy on his own childhood battle with stuttering, you could have fooled me in this highly mean-spirited, ugly and too-proud-of-itself attitude that I immediately disliked it from the get go and the cutesy touches (Hal's creepy friend's parents use musical therapy with a cello and piano recital of the Violent Femmes' "Blister in The Sun"), the fact NJ (my home state) is once again a one-note joke (and um, shot in BALTIMORE!!!), and namely no likable characters (nope even Hal becomes a real jerk in the long run).
I truly loathed this lame film and hope it doesn't get an audience at all for its attempt to be 'clever' by mixing elements of "Election" and "Rushmore" (in fact rent those instead!)
Words cannot describe how bad this movie is.
They try to make Humbert too sympathetic instead of a monster, when really he is a sympathetic monster, and that is the beauty of the novel Lolita, one moment you hate him the next you feel bad for him.
Yes, Swain was too old to play Lolita but why, why on earth do they have her acting like a 5-year-old.
Running and skipping and jumping and playing with dolls, by age 12 most girls are throwing out their dolls because they want to be more mature and are becoming interested in sex, which is exactly what Lolita was doing in the novel, she was smack-dab in-between the child world and adult world.
I wish Swain would have remembered what it was like at that age instead of trying to over compensate for being too old by acting childish but maybe that is what the script required her to do.
With all that said neither film lives up to the book but the Kubrick version gets away with more because he doesn't try to stay true to the novel, which is a masterpiece.
No one will ever be able to capture the beauty of Lolita on film and I hope this is the last time they try.
When you are sitting watching an action film and the only thing you can think of is, 'Well, at least a lot of stuntmen got work', there is something wrong with the film.
In this film, there are too many problems to list.
Where was the writer?
Obviously, the script was bought and the writer was not brought aboard to work on it as the film went on.
The story was weak and beaten to death.
Wow. What a concept.
Unfortunately, all of these were involved in this film.
The continuity alone is enough to drive the average viewer insane.
Water? Yes. Water. I guess no one wanted to do any research and look for compounds that don't dilute quickly and become ineffective in water.
Am I asking too much in asking to SOME thought process while developing this film?
Then there is Vin Diesel. I can guarantee you, he was a much better bouncer than he ever will be an actor.
Does he have only one tone to his voice?
It's okay for a short film or small part in a film, but a whole feature?
It's like listening to Schwarzenegger, but he can do some acting.
A body and a voice do not an actor make.
Do you know who Jeff Chandler is?
Exactly!
Stay away from this film like the plague.
It's just bad.
Unfortunately, it is not worth the $9.00 to go see her only.
It would be best to get it on cheap rental day at the video store.
Then, get a group of people together to pull money to 'share the pain'.
Just thinking of this film makes my stomach sour.
Spoiler Alert One would think a movie featuring Robert Deniro and Edward Norton would be good.
I rented this film with high expectations, and I was completely disappointed.
The film slowly led into some elaborate heist of some sword which was worth a lot of money.
I endured the boring pre-heist moments, expecting a good final scene.
It never came.
But besides that, the movie was terrible.
The most "exciting" scene of the movie dragged out for what seemed to be hours.
The ending was disappointing.
What?!? Come on, that was ridiculous.
I can't believe Norton and Deniro wasted their time making this film, and I can't believe I wasted my time watching it.
I give it 3 out of 10 (and that only because Deniro and Norton are two of my personal favorites)
Why did I buy this one?
I tried her Latin dance video a few years ago and it was awful...and now this.
Save your money and don't.
First of all-you can't teach a belly dance video if you can't belly dance yourself.
The first thing I noticed was that Kathy can't keep a rhythm and you cannot properly execute most of the moves-so it was a bad idea to have her lead this video.
Just to throw out a few examples of this-when Kathy was leading clockwise chest circles in the slow segment (lifting the chest up, to one side, down, then to the other side) she was letting her chest collapse to center between each move rather than holding it there.
So, she was teaching a "chest circle" but she was not doing one.
She was actually doing a "chest lift, chest slide, chest drop, chest slide" because she was collapsing her chest to center and not executing the movement properly.
She also had trouble with basic belly dance moves such as the hip drop pattern where you drop forward, back, back, back...she was too inflexible in the hips so you ended up with forward, back, same, same.
I understand that she is a beginner, and that she is not a belly dancer.
Kathy doesn't need to be a "pro" to teach these basic moves-but these are basic moves that in my area are taught in the first 10 weeks of beginning class.
Kathy should have at least taken belly dance lessons for a few months from Ansuya before putting out this video-or at least long enough to master the moves she was teaching in this video.
Her snake arms were stiff and lifeless and she let her arm form collapse on the downward motion of the arms every time.
Belly dance is harder than it looks-and sometimes it takes a while to fully grasp these moves and to do them well-you can't take lessons for one month, and then put out a video.
This was not even the worst part of the video, in my opinion.
You cannot belly dance in your "perky step aerobics instructor" persona.
I have NEVER seen a belly dancer perform and all of sudden squeal out "OOOOOooooowwww!"
This is something that has annoyed me in Kathy Smiths fitness videos for years, but at least it is okay for an exercise instructor to be obnoxiously perky.
(although I avoid exercise videos by instructors like this) This is ESPECIALLY out of place in belly dance, however.
You wouldn't see a ballerina or a tap dancer shout out like that in the middle of a number, and I feel that Middle Eastern dance deserves the same respect.
I found Kathy's overall attitude about belly dance appalling.
Her "woo-hoo!"
I thought it was going to be much better.
